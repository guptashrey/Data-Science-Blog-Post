## 1. Introduction

This project is a Part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.

By using the [Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017) data, we have tried answer the following questions:
Questions:
  - How does the gender diversity in the Data Science field looks like?
  - Which programming languages and tools are most widely used by professionals?
  - Do professionals belonging to some countries prefer working remotely as compared to others?
